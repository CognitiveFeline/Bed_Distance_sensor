## Bed Distance sensor for 3D printer---BDsensor 

This is a high resolution inductive distance sensor, it can measure the distance from bed to nozzle with distance resolution 0.01mm.

there is no distance sensor used on the 3D printer for it's high price with this high resoluion,all the bed level sensor used on 3D printer is proximity e.g. the BLTouch.
 
### there are 2 advantage :

1. ####  with this sensor the printer can adjust the z axis in real time if the bed plate is not flat in every point,also no need to do probe points before every print.not only the plate not flat itself but also the high and uneven temperature will also cause the plate to expand and contract.

2. ####  you can do mesh bed leveling like normal proximity sensor but much faster with this sensor, because it's no z axis down and up at every probe point.so you can do more probe points in short time.
