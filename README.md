## Bed Distance Sensor --- 3D printer Bed Leveling

BDsensor is a non-contact Dial Indicator

BDsensor is a high resolution inductive **Bed Distance Sensor**, it can measure the distance from bed to nozzle with distance resolution 0.01mm in real time.
there is now no distance sensor used on the **3D printer** for it's high price with this high resoluion for example [IWFK20Z8704](https://www.walkerindustrial.com/IWFK-20Z8704-S35A-BAUMER-10155694-p/iwfk-20z8704-s35a.htm) is $575,all the bed level sensor used now on 3D printer is proximity switch e.g. the BLTouch.
 
### Benefits
1,Manual Bed leveling: The Distance between bed and hotend will be displayed on the screen while you do manual bed leveling so you do not need paper.[video](https://youtu.be/5Hh-R__WlqY)

2,Auto Bed leveling:there is no Z axis up and down while do mesh bed leveling probe,so whole bed leveling will be very fast.[Test Video](https://video.wixstatic.com/video/0d0edf_f2f0b38c765e43c680faaa4f673a74b6/480p/mp4/file.mp4)

3,Auto adjust hotend at every point in real time.[video](https://youtu.be/4qdCDU4c2ac)

4, Easy to use, for there is no Z offset setting.

### Arduino Testing code:
here is the arduino testing code,it's very simple, you can read the distance data from BDsensor after init the communication port.

```
void setup() {
  delay(500);
  // init the communication port.
  BD_SENSOR_I2C.i2c_init(I2C_BED_SDA,I2C_BED_SCL,0x3C,10);
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
    unsigned short read_data=0;
    //read distance from BDsensor
    read_data=BD_SENSOR_I2C.BD_i2c_read();    
    if(BD_SENSOR_I2C.BD_Check_OddEven(read_data)==0)
      printf("Data Check error!\n");
    else
    {
      Distance=(read_data&0x3ff)/100.0;
      //display the Distance
      sprintf(tmp_1,"Distance:%.2f mm\n",Distance);
      printf(tmp_1);
    }
    delay(100);
}
```

### [Installing Bed Distance Sensor](https://github.com/markniu/Bed_Distance_sensor/wiki/Installing-Bed-Distance-Sensor)

### Marlin Firmware:
The BDsensor have been integrated to Marlin2.1.x(Since 2022.8.27),you can download the latest here: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin What do you need is change the configure file and pins file.

### Calibrate:
Why calibrate?

we need to calibrate this sensor before first use or the bed plate have been changed to different materials,
Because different metal plates may have different electromagnetic properties.
normally this process will take about within one minute in 3D printer .

Calibrate steps:

1)Move the Nozzle down until it just touch the bed plate(as the 0 distance).

2)Power on the printer, Send gcode `M102 S-6`,then it will move the z axis slowly up 0.1mm everytime until it reach to 4mm.done


## There are 3 ways to do auto bed leveling:
**1.Real time leveling at first few layers with M102**

we can easily enable or disable this auto level by sending gcode command or and adding gcode in the gcode file.

To enable bed leveling in Cura, add the M102 G-Code right below the G28 (Home All Axes) G-code in the Start G-code section of your printerâ€™s Machine Settings.
For example `M102 S2` below the G28 , that means it will only do bed leveling below 0.2mm of Z axis height.

Send `M102 S0`or`G28`or `M18` will disable bedlevel with BDsensor,BTW,this is disabled by default.

```
//M102   S-5     Read raw Calibrate data
//M102   S-6     Start Calibrate 
//M102   S4      Set the adjustable Z height value,e.g. M102 S4  means it will do adjusting while the Z height <=0.4mm , disable it by M102 S0.
//M102   S-1     Read sensor information
```

**2. Auto Bed Leveling with G29**

Another way to do auto bed leveling is like BLtouch with G29,just add a line G29 before G28.

**3. Combine the above Real time leveling(M102) and Auto Bed Leveling(G29)**

### Raw Data
Here is the data diagram of this sensor, we can see that the distance resolution can be <0.005 below the 5mm.
