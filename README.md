##  The Future of 3D printer Bed Leveling

[BDsensor](https://www.pandapi3d.com/bdsensor) is the first distance sensor that can work with 3D printer and do fast bed leveling and adjust z axis in real time.
it can measure the bed distance at any point in real time without moving the z axis up and down.

Faster leveling, realtime compensation, high accuracy.

1. No need to do probe points before every print, it will be automatically compensated for based on actual distance in real time.
 
2. You can do bed mesh leveling like a normal proximity sensor but much faster with this BDsensor.
   
3. Thanks for the distance value can be shown on the screen, you can do manual bed leveling more easily.

Sensor type: inductive, can only measure the metal plate.

Range: 4mm

Resolution:0.01mm

### Hardware:
* Support all the mainboards
* Easy to install:

  small and light; can be installed anywhere, even surrounding metal above;no need to open the mainboard box as it is compatible with BLtouch connections.
* Support Can bus module
